# Quadcopter-Arduino-Flight-Controller
This is my homemade quadcopter project. It uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope combined in a complimentary filter to recieve the accurate angular position of the quad. This repository contains the flight controller code that goes on the arduino on the quadcopter, and it also contains the remote controller code that runs on a seperate arduino connected to a remote I made (it's really just two joystick modules).
