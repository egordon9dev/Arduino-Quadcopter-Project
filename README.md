# Quadcopter-Arduino-Flight-Controller
This is my homemade flight controller for my homemade quadcopter. It uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope combined in a complimentary filter to recieve the accurate angular position of the quad. This repository also contains the controller code that runs on a seperate arduino.
