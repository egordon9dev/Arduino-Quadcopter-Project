# Quadcopter-Arduino-Flight-Controller
This is my homemade quadcopter project. It uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope combined by sensor fusion done on the MPU6050 to recieve the accurate angular position of the quad. The quadcopter uses this angular position to feed into its PID controller to remain stable during flight. This repository contains the flight controller code that goes on the arduino on the quadcopter, and it also contains the remote controller code that runs on a seperate arduino connected to a remote I made. Both arduinos communicate with an nr24l01+ module. A high power one with the large antenna is used on the controller for transmitting signals and a lower power one is used on the quadcopter for recieving signals.
